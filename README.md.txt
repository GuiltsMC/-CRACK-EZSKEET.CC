         To use this client you must put the .Json and the .jar in a folder, then 
         drag that into the versions folder. To access that, press the Windows key+R
         and do as follows:.minecraft/versions and drag and drop. If it doesn't show up 
         the launcher, it's because you must first download the version. To do that,
         head into the launcher, and look for either Exhibition or the name of the .jar
         then click it. Press done and load it up to experience the greatness of Skeet.cc!
